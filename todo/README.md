Summary
In this session, I developed a comprehensive Flutter task management application with user authentication and task management functionalities. Here are the key highlights of the application:

User Authentication: Implemented secure user authentication using the DummyJSON API.
Task Management: Enabled users to view, add, edit, and delete tasks with proper CRUD operations.
Pagination: Efficiently handled a large number of tasks using pagination.
State Management: Utilized the BLoC pattern to manage the state efficiently across the app.
Local Storage: Ensured persistent data storage using Shared Preferences.
Unit Tests: Added comprehensive unit tests to cover critical functionalities, ensuring robustness.
Responsive Design: Incorporated flutter_screenutil to make the UI responsive across different screen sizes.
Code Highlights
BLoC Setup: Created separate BLoC classes for authentication and task management, ensuring a modular architecture.
Repository Pattern: Implemented a repository pattern to handle data operations, including network calls using Dio and Retrofit.
Mocking for Testing: Generated mock classes using mockito for testing purposes.
Responsive UI: Utilized flutter_screenutil for responsive design, making the app adaptable to various screen sizes.
